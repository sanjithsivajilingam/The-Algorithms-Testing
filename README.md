# The-Algorithms-Testing

## About
TheAlgorithms is an open-source repository designed to aid in learning Data Structures and Algorithms through code examples available in various programming languages. It encompasses a wide range of algorithms, including dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, string manipulation, stacks, and mathematical operations, making it a versatile resource for diverse programming needs.

The project aims to ensure the proper functionality and accuracy of these algorithms. This is accomplished by developing and applying test cases using four methodologies: Input Space Partitioning, Graph-based Testing, Logic-based Testing, and Mutation Testing. The tools and technologies required for running and testing TheAlgorithms include Eclipse, Java, JUnit4, TestNG, and Clover4.
