# The-Algorithms-Testing

## About
TheAlgorithms is an open-source repository designed to aid in learning Data Structures and Algorithms through code examples available in various programming languages. It encompasses a wide range of algorithms, including dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, string manipulation, stacks, and mathematical operations, making it a versatile resource for diverse programming needs.

## Objective
The project aims to ensure the proper functionality and accuracy of these algorithms. This is accomplished by developing and applying test cases using four methodologies: Input Space Partitioning, Graph-based Testing, Logic-based Testing, and Mutation Testing.

## Tools and Technologies
The tools and technologies that were used for running and testing TheAlgorithms include:
- IDE: Eclipse
- Programming Language: Java
- Testing Frameworks: JUnit4, TestNG
- Code Coverage Tool: Clover4
